# Overview
This repository contains the materials for a workshop on reproducibility given at the [IMPRS Conference](http://imprsconference.mpi.nl/) in 2020.

For science to be verifiable it needs to be, minimally, reproducible; running the same analysis on the same data should give the same results.
This may sound easy but it's really not!
This workshop covers how to organise projects with reproducibility in mind, how to document them, and how to share them in a way that'll stay reproducible regardless of software versions.

# How to use these materials
- First, fork this repository to your GitHub account
- Then, create an R project in RStudio using the 'version control' option
- Paste in the link to your fork
- Navigate to the 'code' folder, open the IMPRS_Conf2020_reproducibility.Rmd or .html file and follow along :smile:
